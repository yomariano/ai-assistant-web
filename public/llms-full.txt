# VoiceFleet — Complete Product Documentation for LLMs

> VoiceFleet is an AI voice receptionist for small businesses. It answers phone calls 24/7 with human-like conversation, books appointments, takes messages, handles customer inquiries, and sends call summaries. Built specifically for dental practices, restaurants, salons, and service businesses in Ireland and Argentina.

---

## Product Overview

VoiceFleet solves the #1 problem for small businesses: missed phone calls. Research shows 60-70% of callers who reach voicemail never call back — they call the next business on Google instead. VoiceFleet eliminates this by answering every call instantly.

When a customer calls a VoiceFleet-powered business:
1. The AI picks up within one ring
2. It greets the caller naturally (e.g., "Hi, thanks for calling Dr. Murphy's Dental Practice, how can I help you today?")
3. It understands the caller's intent through natural conversation
4. It takes action: books an appointment, answers a question, takes a message, or transfers to the business owner for urgent matters
5. It sends the business owner a call summary via SMS and email

The AI handles multiple calls simultaneously — no busy signals, no hold music, no missed opportunities.
