## What VoiceFleet Does

VoiceFleet is a SaaS product that provides AI-powered voice agents for business phone lines. When a customer calls, VoiceFleet's AI receptionist answers in a natural human-like voice, understands the caller's intent, and takes action: booking appointments, taking messages, answering FAQs, routing urgent calls to staff, or sending instant summaries via SMS/email.
